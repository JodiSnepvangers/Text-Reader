# Text Reader
My very first program made standalone in Java using Swing. It Allows text to be copied into it, and when started will separate the text into separate sentences. The buttons below all for switching between sentences, changing the font size, and even highlighting per word to give reading impaired something to focus on while reading their text.

The keyboard can also be used to control the program:
Use left and right arrow keys to skip forward or backward. 
Use up and down arrow keys to adjust font size. 
Press spacebar to highlight the next word, and shift to go back.
